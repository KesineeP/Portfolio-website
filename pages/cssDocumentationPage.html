    <header>Introduction</header>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.</p>
    <p>In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles — very basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>
    <p>However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="What_is_CSS?">
    <header>What is CSS?</header>
    <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
    <p>A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
    <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="How_does_CSS_actually_work?">
    <header>How does CSS actually work?</header>
    <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
      <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.</li>
      <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
      <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).
      </li>
      <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.</li>
      <li>The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="About_the_DOM">
    <header>About the DOM</header>
    <p>A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.</p>
    <p>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up. When you start working with browser DevTools you will be navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules apply.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="What_happens_if_a_browser_encounters_CSS_it_doesn't_understand?">
    <header>What happens if a browser encounters CSS it doesn't understand?</header>
    <p>In an earlier lesson I mentioned that browsers do not all implement new CSS at the same time. In addition, many people are not using the latest version of a browser. Given that CSS is being developed all the time, and is therefore ahead of what browsers can recognise, you might wonder what happens if a browser encounters a CSS selector or declaration it doesn't recognise.</p>
    <p>The answer is that it does nothing, and just moves on to the next bit of CSS!</p>
    <p>If a browser is parsing your rules, and encounters a property or value that it doesn't understand, it ignores it and moves on to the next declaration. It will do this if you have made an error and misspelled a property or value, or if the property or value is just too new and the browser doesn't yet support it.</p>
    <p>Similarly, if a browser encounters a selector that it doesn't understand, it will just ignore the whole rule and move on to the next one.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Syntax">
    <header>CSS Syntax</header>
    <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."</p>
    <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
    <code>h1 { color: red; font-size: 5em; }</code>
    <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings h1.</p>
    <p>We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>
    <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.</p>
    <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
    <code>h1 { color: red; font-size: 5em; }</code>
    <br>
    <code>p { color: black; }</code>
    <p>You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget, or want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Modules">
    <header>CSS Modules</header>
    <p>As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains. You will also find links to the CSS Specification that defines the technology (see below).</p>
    <p>At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification.</p>
    <p>For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Browser_support">
    <header>Browser support</header>
    <p>Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented it. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the screen. We'll look at this process more in the lesson How CSS works. It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same time, and so there is usually a gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. For this reason, being able to check implementation status is useful. On each property page on MDN you can see the status of the property you are interested in, so you can tell if you will be able to use it on a website.</p>
    <p>What follows is the compat data chart for the CSS font-family property.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Adding_CSS_to_our_document">
    <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
    <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>
    <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.</p>
    <p>To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the <head> of the HTML document:</p>
    <code>< link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" ></code>
    <p>This <code>< link ></code> element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file: </p>
    <code>h1 { color: red; }</code>
    <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.</p>
    <p>You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Styling_HTML_elements">
    <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
    <p>By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:</p>
    <code>p { color: green; }</code>
    <p>You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:</p>
    <code>p, li { color: green; }</code>
    <p></p>

    <header>Introduction to CSS layout</header>
    <p>CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.  The page layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Normal flow</li>
      <li>The display property</li>
      <li>Flexbox</li>
      <li>Grid</li>
      <li>Floats</li>
      <li>Positioning</li>
      <li>Table layout</li>
      <li>Multiple-column layout</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what each method is designed for you will be in a good place to understand which is the best layout tool for each task.</p>
